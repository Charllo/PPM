# Python3 Package Manager
_As if cargo + npm had a baby_

### Introducing PPM!
 - Download modules and libraries from PyPI, GitHub, anywhere!
 - A built-in setup utility for developing libraries.

### Why PPM?
It's true, there is already a reputable manager for downloading python modules, but when you look at package managers available for other languages, don't you wish Python had something better?

### Notes and Dependencies.
 - Certain PPM functions require Git to be used. If Git isn't installed, PPM will raise an error message and ask you to install Git.


### Development.
PPM is currently being prototyped in Python3, however there will shortly be a compiled release built in Rust. If you want to help development, feel free to "muck in" and help out.
